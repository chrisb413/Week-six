- Tried to incorporate as much as i could into this assignment with what i had covered in the previous tasks.  Given that i was only doing parts/sections of each assignment to catch up i was quite limited in choices.  As a result some of the steps I did were primarily demonstrative and less practical in the direction i took the assignment.

- Chose to look at George Orwell's Diaries.

# Steps: #

- At first i tried to wget the text from the site but kept getting some robot.txt error report and it would also download a file called index.html which was just a copy of the html on the webpage with nothing about the actual text i wanted.
 
- After getting fed up (and running out of time) i decided to take screenshots of the text and OCR it.
	- This worked out quite well however i noticed it did not differenciate plain text from Italics. The italics was a sort of footnotes by the editor of the site.
	- My aim was to filter this out in Sublime text but as i stated above it just turned everything into regular text.
- I posted several pictures (screenshot.697 - screenshot.705) relating to the original pictures. Picture #706 is the code to OCR it (Pretty much copy pasted from your code).

- Pics 707-712 were the steps i took to filter and edit the text inside Sublime text.  I realized afterwards that when i filtered the lines starting with [#] i simply removed those boxes and not the text after it.  Oops!

- Once that was done i popped it into Excel to see if my 19,10,42 was going to split into different cells like i was hoping.  It did that which was a relief, however, the main-bodies of text were completely messed up because they too used commas.  (*Filtering for Excel was more to showcase what I learned and wasnt actually neccisary when mapping later).

- Lastly i took the text and created a mapjs map.  I ordered it by location and put it in chronical order.  Purpose for using the map was also just a proof of concept/knowledge as opposed to being super useful.  The text would breifly mention a event taking place in the world, however each of these diary enteries are only a few weeks/months apart from one-another.


# Reflection Question: #
In your journal.md for this week, share the results of your explorations. Also, think about this: 
Digital history is a process of encountering a body of information that suggests a question or two to you and then cycling back to that body of information to better understand the question (we haven’t even got to an answer yet!). In so doing, you’ll discover that the information is messy, or in the not-quite-right format. 80% of our time, as digital historians, is just getting things into shape for us to begin our exploration! 
Reflect on Michelle Moravec’s own cycle of exploration and what that might imply for yours.

- To be completely honest i kept zoning out when listening to the "Visualizing Schneemann" blog. She was explaining things that went way over my head.  (btw, I use text-to-speech to get through material quicker as im sloooow at reading).  I Found myself trying to understand her tables and graphs and pictures instead.  They all seemed so complex and from what i was hearing provided a very detailed understanding of Schneemann's articulation in her letters.  How she wrote the letters and the words she chose are helpful as Michelle Moravec points out, to gain insight into how a person was thinking and feeling.
- This level of sophistication and detail is way more precise than i could ever imaging doing myself.  I find myself curious with solving broader questions/intrests and rarely (if ever) hone in on anyone one topic/intrest.
